## About <a name = "about"></a>
Inspired by [Capture2Text](http://capture2text.sourceforge.net/), Cloe is a snipping tool for the [Manga OCR library](https://pypi.org/project/manga-ocr/). The project works similarly to Capture2Text but uses the MangaOCR model instead. See demo below to see how it works.
